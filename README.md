# hello-world
first ever repository
Hi, 
I am a physician working as a hospitalist interested in inpatient glycemic control, diabetes, and patient centered care.  I'm interested in seeing if there is a way to integrate easier ways to help patients with diabetes manage their chronic illness in cool ways, and also am a co-investigator in a research study and am interested in potentially using Research Kit to maximize our participants' time and energy.
